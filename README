Intended to be a framework to simulate AI swarm environments. Done in java. Currently does an Montecarlo type ant swarm simulation. Was created for a class project. Commenting is sparse, although I intend to improve that this summer. If you are interested in playing around with this project, leave a message or email me at cableraywire@gmail.com. More info on this project is available at http://cableray.name/2011/05/ant-foraging-algorithms/ .

Enjoy!
